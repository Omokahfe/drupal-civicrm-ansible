Drupal - CiviCRM Ansible Demo installation to AWS

Automated Drupal and CiviCRM secure cloud installation with SSL certificate using https://letsencrypt.org/

Automates the creation of a new server with Drupal 7 and CiviCRM using Ansible. 

The server uses Nginx on an AWS micro instance

The automation installs Drupal 7 and CiviCRM on the server in a secure fashion with SSL certificate from https://letsencrypt.org/. 
CiviCRM and Drupal are installed in different databases as this is considered best practice.

Use this as starting point for your own setups.
